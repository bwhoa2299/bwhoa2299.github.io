## Ben Ouaou
Hello everyone, my name is Ben Ouaou (pronounced "whoa") and I am a senior undergraduate studying geography with a GIS track at CU Boulder. I also have some background in biology/botany/ecology. Through the Earth Analytics Data Science Bootcamp, I'm interested in learning basic data science and programming skills to pair with my GIS knowledge. I am originally from South Florida and in my free time I love to write, play/see music, ski, and watch sports.
